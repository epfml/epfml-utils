# EPFML Utilities

Internal tools for the MLO lab of EPFL.

## Installation

```shell
❯ pip install epfml-utils
```

Add environment variables to your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent file:

```bash
export EPFML_STORE_S3_ACCESS_KEY = # Ask a friend.
export EPFML_STORE_S3_SECRET_KEY = # Ask a friend.
export EPFML_STORE_S3_ENDPOINT = "https://s3.epfl.ch"
export EPFML_STORE_S3_BUCKET = "13319-6af98428eae7a50adb5158685e34011d"
export EPFML_LDAP = # Your Gaspar username.
```

and make sure they are loaded:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
echo $EPFML_LDAP  # Check if this prints your username.
```


## Key-value store

This key-value store can help to transfer information between machines.
Do not expect this to be fast or high-volume.
__Don't__ use this 100's of times in a training script.

### Command-line usage

On one machine:
```shell
❯ epfml store set my_name "Bob"
```
On any other machine:
```shell
❯ epfml store get my_name
Bob
```

### Python usage

```python
import torch
import epfml.store

epfml.store.set("my_data", {"name": "Bob", "lab": "MLO"})
epfml.store.set("tensor", torch.zeros(4))
```

```python
print(epfml.store.get("tensor"))
epfml.store.unset("tensor")
print(epfml.store.pop("my_data"))  # get and delete
```


## Transporting code between machines

### Packing

Upload a copy of the current working directory:

```shell
❯ epfml bundle pack
📦 Packaged and shipped.
⬇️ Unpack with `epfml bundle unpack mlotools_20230202_a205e830 -o .`.
```

To exclude (large / non-code) files from the package, add a config file to the directory

```shell
❯ epfml bundle init
📦 Default config file written to `/Users/vogels/epfl/mlotools/.epfml.bundle.toml`.
```

and customize it to your needs.

### Unpacking

You can download the code into a directory:

```shell
epfml bundle unpack mlotools_20230202_a205e830 -o some_directory
```

Or you can run a training script, or any other shell command, in a temporary check-out of the package:

```shell
❯ epfml bundle exec mlotools_20230202_a205e830 -- du -sh
🏃 Running inside a tmp clone of package `mlotools_20230202_a205e830`.
